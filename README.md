DartsMania
==========

It is a Yii Framework (http://yiiframework.com) extension, so you'll need a running *Yii* install to use it.

Currently only supports the classic *301* game. - sorry :/

Installation
------------

*Step 1* extract the content under _protected/extensions_
*Step 2* call it in a view like:
```php
$this->widget( 'ext.dartsmania.dartsmania' );
```
*Step 3* play
